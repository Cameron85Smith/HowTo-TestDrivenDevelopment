# What is Test-Driven Development?

Unit testing is a mechanism which allows us to have a suite of tests that can be automatically run, where the results can be verified automatically as well.

Usually, without a well defined approach to software development, developers can find themselves in the circle of hell. The circle of hell can look like this, in practice:

A developer writes production code and delivers the product, but now there is a bug in production. The developer gets back to the code and fixes the bug. **The developer then writes a unit test to ensure that the bug does not come back**, and the circle of hell repeats itself indefinitely.
